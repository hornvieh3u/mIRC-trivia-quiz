For our new quiz game project, we aim to build an interactive multiplayer trivia system where players can join, answer questions, and compete for points in real-time. The game will involve a bot that asks questions, and players will respond with their answers. The game will track player scores, provide hints if needed, and rank players based on their performance. Players will have a time limit to answer each question, and different types of questions will be supported, including exact match, multiple choice, and true/false.

Key features include starting and stopping the game, managing rounds, handling the time limit for answers, and keeping track of a leaderboard to display player rankings. The focus is on a smooth user experience with responsive gameplay, where players are rewarded for speed and accuracy. We want to keep it simple at first, but scalable enough to add more features as needed.

Below is a basic architecture for an mIRC Trivia Quiz system, covering class structure and main functionalities like starting, stopping, managing active states, time limits, types of answers, and points/ranking. This outline can serve as a blueprint for your development team, with clear descriptions of the responsibilities of each class and function.

Class & Function Architecture for mIRC Trivia Quiz

1. Class: TriviaGame

This class will manage the overall game flow, including starting and stopping the game, keeping track of active state, managing players, and assigning points.

Attributes:

• game_id: int - A unique identifier for the trivia game.
• status: str - Current game state (inactive, active, stopped).

• current_question: Question - The question currently being asked.
• time_limit: int - Time in seconds allowed for answering each question.
• rounds_played: int - Tracks how many questions have been asked.
• max_rounds: int - Maximum number of questions per game.
• leaderboard: dict - Tracks player points and rank.

Methods:

• init(self, game_id: int, max_rounds: int, time_limit: int):
Initializes the game with a unique ID, sets a time limit for questions, and defines the number of rounds.
• start_game(self):

• stop_game(self):
• Stops the game, changes the status to stopped, and displays the final rankings.
• next_round(self):
• Moves to the next question in the game. Fetches a new question, resets timers, and prepares the players for a new question.
• check_answer(self, player: Player, answer: str):
• Verifies if the player’s answer is correct. If correct, assigns points based on the speed and correctness. Updates the player’s score in the leaderboard.
• show_leaderboard(self):
• Displays the current ranking of all players based on points.
• end_game(self):
• Ends the game after all rounds are completed or the stop command is issued. Displays final leaderboard and ranks players.

2. Class: Question

This class will manage each question in the trivia game, including the question text, the correct answer, and the type of answer required.

Attributes:

• question_id: int - A unique identifier for the question.
• text: str - The trivia question being asked.
• answer: str - The correct answer to the question.
• answer_type: str - The type of answer required (exact, multiple_choice, true_false).
• choices: list[str] - List of answer choices (used if answer_type is multiple_choice).
• hint: str - Optional hint for the question.
• time_to_answer: int - Time allocated for players to answer this question.

Methods:

• init(self, question_id: int, text: str, answer: str, answer_type: str, choices: list[str] = None, hint: str = None, time_to_answer: int = 30):
• Initializes a new question with text, correct answer, and type of answer (multiple choice, exact, etc.). Optional hint and multiple-choice options can be added.
• provide_hint(self):
• Returns the hint if it is available, or generates a partial hint (e.g., first letter or letter count).
• is_correct(self, player_answer: str) -> bool:
• Compares the player’s answer to the correct answer. For multiple_choice, checks if the player’s answer matches one of the options.

3. Class: Player

This class will track each player’s performance, including their score and rank.

Attributes:

• player_id: int - Unique identifier for the player.
• name: str - Player’s nickname or username.
• score: int - The player’s total score.
• rank: int - The player’s rank on the leaderboard.
• answered_correctly: int - Number of questions answered correctly.
• answer_speed: list[int] - Tracks the time it took the player to answer correctly for each round.

Methods:

• init(self, player_id: int, name: str):
• Initializes a player with a unique ID and name.
• update_score(self, points: int):
• Adds points to the player’s score after they answer a question correctly.
• update_rank(self, rank: int):
• Updates the player’s rank based on their total score compared to other players.

4. Class: TriviaBot

This class simulates the trivia bot that controls the flow of questions, interacts with players, and manages timeouts.

Attributes:

• bot_id: int - A unique identifier for the bot.
• game: TriviaGame - The current game being run by the bot.

Methods:

• init(self, bot_id: int, game: TriviaGame):
• Links the bot with a specific game.
• ask_question(self, question: Question):
• Posts the question to the chat for players to answer.
• give_hint(self, question: Question):
• Provides a hint if no correct answers have been given after a certain time.
• handle_time_up(self):
• If time runs out and no one has answered, the bot can move on to the next question or end the round.
• announce_winner(self):
• Announces the final winner based on the leaderboard rankings.

Game Flow Example

1. Start Game:
• TriviaGame.start_game(): Initializes the game, sets the first question, and notifies the players.
2. Ask Question:
• TriviaBot.ask_question(): Posts the current question to the chat room.
3. Check Answer:
• TriviaGame.check_answer(): Compares the player’s answer to the correct one and assigns points based on correctness and speed.
4. Provide Hint (Optional):
• If no one answers correctly after some time, the bot will call Question.provide_hint() to help the players.
5. Time Runs Out:
• TriviaBot.handle_time_up(): If no one answers within the time limit, the bot will skip to the next question.
6. Next Question / Round:
• TriviaGame.next_round(): The game proceeds to the next question until all rounds are complete.
7. End Game:
• After the last question, TriviaGame.end_game() will be called to display the final rankings and end the game.

Key Features

• Active State: Managed by the TriviaGame class using the status attribute, ensuring the game only accepts answers when the status is active.
• Time to Answer: Each Question has a time_to_answer attribute that determines how long players have to submit answers. Handled by the TriviaBot through handle_time_up().
• Types of Answers:
• Exact Match: Players must type the exact correct answer.
• Multiple Choice: Players can select from options (e.g., A, B, C, D).
• True/False: A simplified answer type where players respond with “True” or “False.”
• Points/Ranking:
• Player.update_score() adds points for correct answers.
• Rankings are calculated and updated in the TriviaGame.leaderboard.

Additional Considerations for Development:

1. Multiplayer Sync: Ensure that the game can handle multiple players answering simultaneously.
2. Bot Responsiveness: The TriviaBot must handle chat responses in real-time for checking answers and announcing results.
3. Scalability: The system should handle various channels hosting different games simultaneously.
4. Customization: Allow for the game settings like max_rounds, time_limit, and answer_type to be easily adjustable.

This architecture provides a solid foundation to build an engaging mIRC trivia system. You can expand or adjust it as needed based on specific game requirements or new features.
